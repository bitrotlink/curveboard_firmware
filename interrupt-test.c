This could be avoided by first setting all lines as inputs, rather than doing the transition atomically.

But putting in just this nop doesn't solve the problem which the 1ms delay above does solve, proving that the problem isn't originating in the uC itself, so the problem must be the breadboard wiring or the keypad itself.

/* KP buttons found to short the following lines (in both directions; thus no diodes):
1       037
2       137
3       237
4       047
5       147
6       247
7       057
8       157
9       257
*       067
0       167
#       267
So, lines 0-6 are for a standard matrix (0-2 run vertically, 3-6 horizontally), and line 7 is common for all buttons, which would allow reading the keypad without scanning (by permanently driving line 7, and reading 0-6) but at the expense of additional ghosting during multiple simultaneous button presses (beyond even the ghosting of a traditional diode-less keypad). Because of the presence of that common line, the keypad generates ghost keys (either when permanently driving line 7, or when ignoring line 7 and scanning the matrix traditionally) when just two corners of a rectangle in the matrix are pressed (whereas a normal diode-less keypad without a common line generates ghost keys only when three corners of a rectangle are pressed).
Now that I know the configuration, scan_kp no longer needs to scan all eight lines; it suffices to scan just 0-2 and read 3-6 (or vice versa, since there are no diodes). But there's no harm in scanning all eight, other than some wasted time and power. */
